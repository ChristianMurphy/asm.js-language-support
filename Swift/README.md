## Compiler Support

[Swift is built with an LLVM compiler tool chain](https://github.com/apple/swift-llvm), which opens some opportunities to for it to work with [EMScripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/).

There is [ongoing discussion on Swift support in the EMScripten Community](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/2427).
